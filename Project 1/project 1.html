    <h2>The basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
  </div>
    <div class="concept">
      </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>HTML is what glues everything together.
          Web has 30 billion pages.
          Major pieces of the web: you, your computer, the internet and servers
          HTTP-the main protocol of the web
          HTML: hypertext markup language. HTML is made up of text content, markup (what it looks like), references to other documents (video, images). Links to other documents. 
          HTML is made up of tags.  The first is the opening and the last is the closing element. 
          <b> b tag is for bold </b>. You need an opening and closing tag. 
          <em> em is for emphasis. It italicizes the text. </em> 
          <p> HTML attributes: 
          Anchor tag (allows you to create a link). <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
          <br>Image tag  "img" allows you to insert an image.
          <br>Break tag (br)-will insert a break 
          </p>
          <p>Paragraph-will also insert a break.</p>
          There are two types of elements: inline and block elements.
          Inline elements are: b, em, img, span, 
          Block elements: p, div
          Div elements can allow you to break up content by placing them in a container. You can also accomplish this through span tags. Span tags can also be used to break up content within a paragraph. For example, I used a span tag here to change the work brown to <span style="color:brown">brown</span>.
          <br>
          HTML document-the head section contains meta data, java script, css 
          Body: body tags has all the content in it, which is the stuff you see on the screen

    <h2>How learning to code works</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      </div>
      <div class="content">
          There are various stages you will go through: ignorance, awareness, ability and fluency. This course work will help with ignorance, awareness and ability. It will not help with fluency. Fluency takes years. 
         <br>
         Also, frustration is a natural part of learning to code. Even experienced coders get frustrated. If that happens, remember to take a break!

    <h2>Web Page Structure</h2>
  </div>
    <div class="concept">
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        The basic word in the language of html is tags.
        DOM is the: document object model.
        CSS defines the style of an object. 
        Boxes, boxes everywhere: Everything on a web page is actually a box. Here are some main points:
        <ul>
        <li>1.  Draw boxes around your page</li>
        <li>2.  Use Divs to create boxes</li>
        <li>3.  To add style, you need to add classes to your boxes</li>
        <li>The browser builds a tree like structure of the page.</li>
        </ul>
        The analogy of a tree is important to comprehend on how HTML works. Trees have many branches. The main branches of a tree can have their own branches and so on. In HTML you can have elements within elements. Using a tree structure is essential to building and organizing your page. Another analogy that can be used is boxes within boxes which is what you do when you build a web page.

    <h2>Avoiding repetition-Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2>
  </div>
    <div class="concept">
      </div>
      <div class="content">
      <p> CSS allows you to avoid repetition and make good code.
      CSS stands for cascading style sheets.
      CSS works on the concept of <u>inheritance</u>. Wikipedia defines it as follows:  Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants.  Inheritance relies on the document tree, which is the hierarchy of (X)HTML elements in a page based on nesting.</P>
      <p>The first thing you do in CSS is to write a selector. You can apply styles to classes, paragraphs etc
      A good reference for CSS properties can be found at this Mozilla web page: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">Mozilla web page</a>
      One other important thing: You have to refer to the CSS file in the header to make the page work. The header should refer to a separate CSS file. You can also include CSS in your html (this would create a lot of repetition) or put all the CSS in the header vs a separate sheet. 
      Using semantic tags:You should use h1, h2, and h3 tags to describe what is in your page. Search engines also use these tags. 
      <br>
      The box model:
      For a box you have margin, border, padding and content. Content is the content (like an image). Padding clears area around content. Border goes around padding and content. Margin clears area outside of border. 
      Sizes of boxes should be set as percents instead of pixels.
      Divs naturally take up an entire row. If you want divs (boxes) stacked next to each other you can use flex box. 
      <br>
      To add images:
      1.  Save your image to a separate folder.
      2.  To get your image to show up on the page you need to make sure the code is in your html. Make sure you use the appropriate code including img=src and then the folder you are storing it in.

    <h2>Recipe for success: Code, test and refine</h2>
  </div>
    <div class="concept">
      </div>
      <div class="content">
      Here are some steps for success: 
      <ul>
      <li>1.  Divide and conquer-look to boxify</li>
      <li>2.  Look for repeated styles and semantic elements-headers (h1, h2)</li>
      <li>3.  Write html</li>
      <li> 4.  Apply styles (css)</li>
      <li> 5.  Then fix the small things-iterate</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Developer tools is the best way to change things and see what happens.
      To validate HTML and CSS to make sure they comply with standards. You can use the below html:To verify HTML: http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
      To verify CSS: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input
